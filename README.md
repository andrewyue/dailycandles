# Stock Visualization Using Flask on Heroku

This repository contains a Flask application that will query the [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/data/WIKI) stock database for daily open, close, high, and low prices for the supplied ticker, then produce a [candlestick chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart) of the last month's worth of data.
